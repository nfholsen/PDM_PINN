This software is a computer program whose purpose is to
compute the analytical solution of problems of waves propagation in two 
layered media in 2D such as
- acoustic/acoustic
- acoustic/elastodynamic
- acoustic/porous
- elastodynamic/elastodynamic
- porous/porous,
based on the Cagniard-de Hoop method.

                      Short Description of the code
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I) The main program is lib/bin/Gar6more2D.F90.

II) The directory mod/ contains all files for the
declaration of the common variables.

III) The directory lib/libgeneral contains
functions used by most of the subroutines : the
source function source.F90, the computation of the
path in the complex plane path.F90, the
computation of the derivate dp/dt derivee.F90.

IV) The directory includefic contains the interface files.

V) The directory lib/acousacous contains the
subroutines for the computation of the incident
wave (sub_incid_aa.F90), the reflected wave
(sub_reflex_*_aa.F90) and the transmitted wave
(sub_transmit_*_aa.F90) in the acoustic/acoustic
case.

VI) The directory lib/acouselasto contains the
subroutines for the computation of the incident
wave (sub_incid_ae.F90), the reflected wave
(sub_reflex_ae.F90), the transmitted P wave
(sub_transmitp_ae.F90) and the transmitted S wave
(sub_transmits_ae.F90) in the
acoustic/elastodynamic case.

VII) The directory lib/acousporo contains the
subroutines for the computation of the incident
wave (sub_incid_ap.F90), the reflected wave
(sub_reflex_ap.F90), the transmitted fast wave
(sub_transmitf_ap.F90), the transmitted psi wave
(sub_transmitpsi_ap.F90) and the transmitted slow
wave (sub_transmits_ap.F90) in the
acoustic/poroelastic case.
The computation of the reflection and transmission coefficients is performed by calccoeff_ap.F90  

VIII) The directory lib/elastoelasto contains the
subroutines for the computation of the incident
waves (sub_incid*_ee.F90), the reflected waves
(sub_reflex*_*_ee.F90) and the transmitted waves
(sub_transmit*_ee.F90) in the 
elastodynamic/elastodynamic case.
The computation of the reflection and transmission coefficients (for P and S waves) is performed by calccoeff*_ee.F90.

IX) The directory lib/poroporo contains the subroutines for the computation 
of the incident waves (sub_incid_pp_*.F90), the reflected waves 
(sub_reflex*_*_pp.F90) and the transmitted waves (sub_transmit*_*_pp.F90) in the 
poroelastic/poroelastic case.
