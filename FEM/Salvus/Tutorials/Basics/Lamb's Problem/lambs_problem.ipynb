In this tutorial, we will validate the accuracy of Salvus_Compute_ by comparing numerically calculated seismograms to semi-analytical solutions of Lamb's Problem in 2-D. In addition to giving us confidence in the synthetic data we will use in future tutorials, it also gives us a chance to gently learn some of the key features of the Salvus API.\n",

In our solution we expect both direct arrivals and those reflected from the free-surface, along with a contribution from the 2-D Rayleigh wave. To validate the solutions generated with Salvus, we will compare our results with semi-analytical ones computed using [EX2DDIR](http://www.spice-rtn.org/library/software/EX2DDIR/softwarerelease.2006-11-10.9258147216.html). We'll consider a half-space bounded at $y=2000$, and excite waves using a Ricker source with a center frequency of 15 Hz. This setup keeps compute times very low, while also allowing for a fair amount of wavelengths to propagate within our domain. To get started, let's first import all the Python tools we'll need."

Well, now is the time -- the discrepencies at later time are due to reflections off the free-surfaces of the domain. We'll now make our domain \"infinite\" by adding some absorbing boundaries at the edge of the domain. In this example we will add a simple Clayton-Enquist style boundary condition. While these boundaries do not perform well for waves hitting the boundaries at small angles, they are advantageous in that they do not need any sort of \"sponge-layers\". We will see how to attach more advanced absorbing boundaries in a future tutorial. For now, we simply need to initialize the AbsobringBoundary object we imported above. To do this, we need to specify at which \"side-sets\" the boundaries will be applied. By default, Cartesian meshes have side-sets which correspond to the edges of the domain (i.e. $[x0, x1, y0, y1]$ in 2-D, and $[x0, x1, y0, y1, z0, z1]$ in 3-D).

In fact, this very notebook, along with many like it, get run every time a new commit is made to the Salvus codebase. If the solutions do not fit as well as is visualized above, the commit is rejected. This helps us ensure that, as more and more features are added, our solutions remain accurate and performant."

Fortunatelly, it's quite easy to run Salvus_Compute_ from the command line as well -- all we need to do is generate a `toml` input file. Let's generate a file from the inputs we've been using so far."
