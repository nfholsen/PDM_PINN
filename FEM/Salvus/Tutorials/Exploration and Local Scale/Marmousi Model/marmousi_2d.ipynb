As models can be stored in a wide variety of format such as [SEG-Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEG-Y), or [RSF](http://www.ahay.org/wiki/Guide_to_RSF_file_format), we use `xarray` as an intermediary to encapsulate both the model parameters and geometry. More info on `xarray`, including extensive documentation, can be found [here](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html).

        "When building material models for use with wave propagation solvers such as Salvus, there are a few factors one needs to consider. Obviously we need to ensure that the spatial complexity of the model is adequetly captured by whatever spatial discretization we are choosing. What is less obvious however is that the details of the solver's spatial discretization are intimitely to both the spatial complexity of the model _and_ the spatial complexity of the physical process we are solving for. When considering the propagation of seismic waves we are somewhat lucky that the solutions are [band-limited](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04529.x) and the spatial complexity of the solution can be reliably estimated before any simulations are run.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the simple formula $\\lambda_{\\text{min}} = v_{\\text{min}} \\cdot f_{\\text{max}}^{-1}$, we have an estimate $\\lambda_{\\text{min}}$ for the minimum wavelength in our simulation when given the minimum velocity in the model ($v_{\\text{min}}$) and the maximum frequency in the forcing function ($f_{\\text{max}}$). It is this minimum wavelength, in conjuction with the spatial complexity of the model itself, which places the most restrictions on how we should build and discretize our model. No matter which numerical method we choose to solve the wave-equation we must have _at least_ a certain number of \"points\" per minimum wavelength to ensure an accurate solution. In finite-difference (FD) simulations, these points are the discrete points of the FD grid. In spectral-element simulations (such as those performed by Salvus) these points are the GLL point locations with each spectral-element.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Salvus, to properly balance accuracy and performance, we suggest to use anywhere from 6 - 9 points per minimum wavelength. When using standard 4th order elements (which have 5 GLL points along each edge), this equates to using __1.25 - 2 elements per wavelength__. With this discussion in mind, one must first determine what frequency band they are interested in _before_ one proceeds to the meshing stage, and this is why we now begin with the definition of our source wavelet. Below we choose a Ricker wavelet with a peak frequency of 1Hz, and plot the source-time function as well as the wavelet's frequency content."

It then follows that, if we're interested in accurately modelling the full bandwidth of the injected source, then we must chose $f_{\\text{max}}$ to be _higher_ than the center frequency of our wavelet. From experience we usually find, when considering a Ricker wavelet, that generating the mesh assuming a maximum frequency which is twice the central frequency provides a good balance between accuracy and performance. It is this rule which we will follow below.\n",

        "To preserve the stability of the wavefield solution in the presence of complex or anisotropic media, Salvus employs a two-stage approach to absorbing boundaries. First, we apply absorbing boundary conditions at the edge of the mesh as outlined [here](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10211573.pdf). These conditions provide good absorbing characteristics for wave impacting the boundary at close to normal incidence, and are sufficient for most cases. If a more substantial absorbing profile is desired, one can also pad the simulated domain with a damping layer. This approach follows that given in [this](https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9991(86)90199-3) paper. Adding damping layers are advantageous in that they can almost completely cancel any boundary reflections, but do require one to enlarge the computational domain and therefore increase the cost of the resultant simulations. We have found that these boundaries, when using 4th order elements, perform best with __7 or more layers of elements__. For the example below we will round this number up to 10. The type and performance of absorbing boundaries your application calls for will vary."

When run in a notebook, this command will plot an interactive 2- or 3-D plot of the simulation mesh, with the available parameters interpolated to the GLL points defining the model interpolation order. This is why we see variability within each element which is plotted below. You can expand the `Parameter` dialog box in order to visualize any parameter present in the mesh. Obviously, we have the spatially variable `VP` and `RHO`, which define 2-D acoustic parameters of our medium. In addition, we have the elemental-parameter `fluid`, along with `absorbing_boundaries`. The `fluid` flag is read by Salvus _Compute_ and is used to determine which elements in the simulation are acoustic and which are elastic. In this case we see that `fluid = 1` everywhere in the mesh, which is telling us that the entire mesh should simulation the fluid (acoustic) wave equation. In __this tutorial__ and __this tutorial__ we explore how to run coupled simulations, and see how one can change the fluid flag at will, and even vary it randomly between individual elements. The `absorbing_boundaries` flag simply shows us where the domain has been un-physically extended for use by the damping layers. This is handy to know, as we don't want to put sources or receivers in this area. As we specified `[\"x0\", \"x1\", \"y0\"]` as our absorbing side-sets, you should see the damping layers extending out of the left, bottom, and right sides of the mesh. Since we will be simulating a free-surface condition at the top of the model, no extension has been made here. As a reminder from earlier tutorials: you can visualize the side sets in the mesh by clicking the \"Show Side Sets\" button in the widget below."

It cannot catch _all_ the possible errors which could occur (for example, if a source or receiver is placed outside of the domain, or if the simulation explodes due to a too-large time step), but it does help catch many common things before you set off a big job. For example, if you one of the fields in the `volume_data.fields` setting, the validator below would catch this."
